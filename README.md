# Solar Microgrid System

## Overview
The Solar Microgrid System combines both hardware and software to provide sustainable energy solutions for communities. The system includes solar panels for energy generation, inverters for converting DC to AC, battery storage for energy storage, charge controllers for managing battery health, and EV charging stations for electric vehicle support. The software side provides a user interface built with React.js to monitor and manage energy usage. Additionally, it integrates real-time weather data to optimize power generation and includes an energy management system for performance analysis and optimization. With built-in security features and event notifications, this system offers a reliable, scalable, and efficient renewable energy solution.

## Features
- **Hardware Components**:
  - Solar Panels: Generate renewable energy.
  - Inverters: Convert DC energy to AC power.
  - Battery Storage: Store energy for later use.
  - Charge Controllers: Manage battery health and ensure longevity.
  - EV Charging Stations: Provide charging support for electric vehicles.
  
- **Software Components**:
  - **React.js Interface**: User-friendly interface to monitor and manage energy usage.
  - **Real-Time Weather Integration**: Optimizes power generation based on weather conditions.
  - **Energy Management System**: Analyzes system performance and suggests optimization strategies.
  - **Security Features**: Authentication mechanisms to protect user data and access.
  - **Event Notifications**: Notifies users of critical system events to ensure smooth operation.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js for the user interface.
- **Backend**: [Specify your backend technologies here, if any, such as Node.js, Python, etc.]
- **Database**: [Mention your database solution if applicable, such as MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.]
- **Cloud/Hosting**: [Specify any cloud providers or hosting services used for deployment, e.g., AWS, Heroku, etc.]
- **Weather API**: [Include the weather data API used for real-time integration, e.g., OpenWeatherMap API]

## Installation
To set up the Solar Microgrid System locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- [List any prerequisites, such as Node.js, npm, Python, etc.]

### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/solar-microgrid-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd solar-microgrid-system
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install  # or pip install -r requirements.txt for Python
